# About
Majin is a small lightweight desktop browser that renders/requests mobile webpages.

It was developed to avoid the hassle of using a full-blown browser just to keep music/videos playing in the background while you work. It also packs a few features like minimizing to desktop's tray and stay on top of other windows.
