# About
Majin is a small lightweight desktop browser that renders/requests mobile webpages.

It was developed to avoid the hassle of using a full-blown desktop browser just to keep music/videos playing in the background while you work. It also packs a few features like minimizing to desktop's tray, stay on top of other windows, quick window resizing in landscape and portrait mode for the most used display devices, changing the user-agent accordingly .
